this is experimental as we will have to make a table for it and then make sure that we have an algorithm that can check out which strains are the most viewed so we will have to add a view counter and then the strains with the highest monthly reviews and all kinds of stuff like that and then create the charts on which is the most viewed and liked by all customers
for later after we get a job and learn how to write our own neural networks and algorithms
