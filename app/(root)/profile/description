side bar showing the sections and as you scroll it changes from the sidebar section to the one you moved into, like in google docs where you can scroll down to a chapter, or when youre scrolling and hit that chapter it tells you
top
have a section that shows the past orders
middle
a section that shows username, email, password
a section that shows first name, last name, address
