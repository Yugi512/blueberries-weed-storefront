basically like the feel goods website but more cream and green
or maybe slate and some neutral colors but make it mute and not as harmful to the eyes

champagne and forest green

or the whole blue set

we switch it out and customize the backgrounds later first we need to have the shapes and templates here first

we can have it be basic-ish like make it pretty but no crazy animations until everything is functional and good so that we can then deploy the application
